# Detection of Pneumonia in Children using AI

This repository contains code for detecting pneumonia in children under-5 years through chest radiographs (CXR) using a VGG19-based deep learning model. The project focuses on addressing pneumonia detection in resource-limited settings, particularly in Nigeria.

This codebase supports the study **"Detection of Pneumonia in Children through Chest Radiographs using Artificial Intelligence in a Low-Resource Setting: A Pilot Study"**. The preprint will be provided soon with detailed insights on performance and methodology.
